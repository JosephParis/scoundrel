// The assigned name is the default identity every player carries onto the public
// board, so it has to satisfy three things at once that are easy to satisfy
// separately: it must fit a handle, survive the denylist, and be stable.
//
// The length one is the trap. The vocabulary is shared with pseudonym.js, which
// has no length budget -- "Candlelit Lamplighter 99" is 24 characters and joins
// with spaces -- so the filtering in assignedName.js is load-bearing and
// silently breaks if either word list grows past the budget.
//
// Since 2026-09-06 the name is one token, "AshenVagrant4718", and the whole
// 44 x 44 vocabulary fits. That is a property worth pinning rather than
// assuming: the moment a word is added that pushes a pair over the budget, the
// filter starts silently discarding pairs again, which is the state this
// change existed to get out of.

// Reasonably spread seeds, rather than 'a'/'b'/'c', so a hash that happened to
// bucket short similar strings together cannot pass this by luck.
