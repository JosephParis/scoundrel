/**
 * GET /api/leaderboard — the public fastest-victory board.
 *
 * Unlike /api/stats this endpoint is unauthenticated: every player sees it, so
 * it returns only what the board renders and never the raw run blob. In
 * particular `account_id` (the Google `sub` claim) is used for grouping and for
 * marking the caller's own rows, then stripped from the response; the only
 * identity that leaves here is `playerName`, the handle the player typed into
 * Settings.
 *
 * Every qualifying victory is listed, handle or not. A run with no handle comes
 * back with `playerName: null` and the client renders it as "Anonymous" (see
 * entryDisplayName in src/utils/leaderboard.js), so a player who never opened
 * Settings still places instead of silently vanishing off a board they earned a
 * spot on. Nothing identifying travels with an unnamed row — rank, time, mode
 * and ascension are the whole payload — so this stays anonymous in fact and not
 * just in name.
 *
 * Only victories qualify — a fast death is not an achievement — and only one
 * row per player, so a quick player can't fill the whole board. Signed-in
 * players group by account (their handle may change; the account is the
 * player), named or not. Guests all share account_id 'guest' and so group by
 * handle instead, which is the only thing distinguishing one guest from
 * another.
 *
 * Which leaves unnamed guests, who carry nothing to tell them apart: they land
 * in one shared bucket and the board shows their single fastest run, not one
 * row each. That is the same anti-flooding rule as everyone else applied to an
 * identity we genuinely cannot resolve — the alternative, a row per run, hands
 * one guest with a stopwatch the entire top 25. The cost is real and worth
 * naming: the second-fastest unnamed guest does not appear. Signing in or
 * setting a handle is what buys a player their own line.
 *
 * Query params:
 *   limit=<n>       rows to return (default 25, max 100)
 *   me=<accountId>  the caller's own account; marks their rows `you: true` and
 *                   adds `self` (their best run and its rank) even when that
 *                   rank falls outside the returned page. Ignored for guests,
 *                   whose account id identifies no one in particular.
 *   device=<id>     what a guest sends instead of `me`: the opaque per-device
 *                   id their runs carry. Same effect, and the only way a guest
 *                   can be shown which row is theirs.
 *   version=<v>     scope the board to one balance version (see GAME_VERSION).
 *                   Absent = all versions.
 *
 * Requires DATABASE_URL. Without it the endpoint 503s and the client shows the
 * board as unavailable; play is never affected.
 *
 * Blocked accounts (issue 08) are subtracted here rather than deleted: an
 * account on the blocklist stops being published everywhere on the board at
 * once, including the caller's-own-rank query, while its runs stay in the table
 * for analytics and its save is untouched.
 *
 * Note that durations are computed client-side (wall clock between run start
 * and run end, minus pauses) and are therefore self-reported. The floor below
 * rejects the obviously impossible, but this board is a friendly ranking, not
 * an anti-cheat system.

// One row per player, their fastest qualifying victory, ranked.

// The partition takes two expressions rather than one concatenated key, so no
// string building is needed: signed-in players group by account_id alone (the
// second expression is a constant for them, and their name may change between
// runs without splitting them into two entries), while guests, who all share
// account_id 'guest', need something else to tell them apart.
//
// That something is `deviceId`, not the player's name. Grouping guests by name
// meant name equality was treated as person equality: two guests who happened
// to share one — assigned or typed — landed in the same bucket, and only the
// faster was ranked at all. The other vanished from a board they had earned a
// place on. A name is a label; identity is the device that posted the run.
//
// The coalesce chain is a migration path, not tidying. Runs predating record
// v8 carry no deviceId and fall back to grouping by name, exactly as they
// always did, so no stored row changes behaviour. The trailing '' catches the
// oldest rows, which have neither and keep sharing one bucket — SQL would
// otherwise treat a bare null as its own group per row.
//
// Kept as a single fragment so the board query and the caller's-own-rank query
// rank against the same population.
