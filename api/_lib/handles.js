/**
 * One name, one owner — the uniqueness rule behind the public board.
 *
 * Two players choosing the same name used to produce two identical rows, which
 * is confusing on a ranking whose whole job is telling runs apart. This makes
 * the name a claimed thing: the first owner to post under it keeps it, and
 * anyone arriving later is disambiguated on the way in.
 *
 * ## Why the server decides, and not the client
 *
 * The obvious design is to check availability while the player types. It does
 * not fit this game. Sigil is offline-first — runs queue locally and post when
 * they can, `/api/runs` being unreachable is an expected state, and nothing in
 * the client may block on the network. A player naming themselves on a plane
 * has to be able to finish that thought.
 *
 * So naming stays local and instant, and uniqueness is settled here, on the way
 * into storage. The cost is that the player does not have final say over their
 * exact string; the response reports what was actually stored so the UI can
 * tell them. That trade only works because a name here is a label on a
 * leaderboard row. If names ever become addresses — used to find, invite or
 * link to a player — this should become a reservation flow instead.
 *
 * ## Why a claim is never released
 *
 * A record stores the name it was posted under, so releasing a name would let a
 * second owner claim it while the first owner's older rows still carry it, and
 * the board would show the duplicate this exists to prevent. Keeping every
 * claim forever makes the invariant hold without the board needing to know
 * anything: **a given string on the board belongs to exactly one owner, always.**
 *
 * Squatting is the accepted cost. At this scale a player accumulating a handful
 * of retired names is not worth the machinery of expiry.
 *
 * ## Who an owner is
 *
 * A signed-in player is their `account_id`. A guest is their `deviceId`, which
 * is the same identity the board partitions guests on. A client too old to send
 * one claims nothing and is stored as-is — it cannot be told apart from any
 * other guest anyway, so there is nothing to protect.
